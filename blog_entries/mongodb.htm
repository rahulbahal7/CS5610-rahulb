We learned MongoDB and Passport JS in the last couple of weeks.
    MongoDB is a cross-platform NoSQL database that 
			stores information in the form of JSON based documents with dynamic schemas. It is fast, supports indexing in any 
			field, supports server side JavaScript execution and Ad-hoc queries.
    PassportJS framework is used for authentication purposes and I will be adding experiments to learn the framework better. It will be implemented
    as the framework for the authentication mechanism in the application.
